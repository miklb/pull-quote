        <p>Pull quotes can be useful in <pull-quote right>calling out a specific quote from a larger body of
                text</pull-quote>. This web component allows you to easily add a pull quote to your site. The component
            is built using web components, so it can be used in any web project, regardless of the framework or CMS you
            are using. It's pretty straightforward and doesn't require any complex setup or configuration to get
            started.</p>

        <p>Here's a bunch of words that could be in the middle of an article that is really complex and deep but at some
            point an important fact <pull-quote>really needs to be emphasized to the reader</pull-quote>. But we don't
            want to take the words out of the flow of the writing or duplicate it but we're going to have a bunch more
            words to fill in the space. This paragraph needs a lot more words to make it effective. So here's some more
            text to demonstrate how the pull quote works in context with longer paragraphs that have more substance and
            flow naturally around the highlighted content.</p>

        <p>Another paragraph for effect. And another sentence. Or more with feeling. I need to really figure out a way
            to generate text from the editor don't I? But seriously, this is just to show how the component works with
            different amounts of text and various paragraph lengths. Sometimes you need short paragraphs, sometimes you
            need longer ones that really dive deep into a topic and explore all the nuances and details that make the
            content rich and engaging for readers.</p>

        <p>Need more text and will add more text here and here and a bunch more words and more words. Now a period. But
            more words. And then some additional thoughts that flow naturally from the previous ideas. <pull-quote
                right>The beauty of this approach is its simplicity</pull-quote> - you don't have to worry about complex
            CSS or JavaScript implementations. Just wrap your text and it works. More filler text here to make this
            paragraph substantial enough to demonstrate the floating behavior properly.</p>

        <p>Let's add another paragraph because why not? This one doesn't have a pull quote but it's here to show how the
            text flows around the previous pull quotes and creates a natural reading experience. The spacing and
            typography should feel comfortable and easy to read, whether you're on a phone, tablet, or desktop computer.
            That's the goal anyway - responsive, accessible, and pleasant to read.</p>

        <p>Final paragraph to wrap things up and give us enough content to really see how this whole thing works in
            practice. <pull-quote>Web components are pretty neat when they work properly</pull-quote> and this one
            should demonstrate that nicely. More words here, more sentences there, just filling out the space so we have
            enough content to make a proper demo that shows off all the features and behaviors of the component in
            different scenarios and contexts.</p>
