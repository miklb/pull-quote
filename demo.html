		<main>
        <p>Pull quotes can be useful in <pull-quote right>calling out a specific quote from a larger body of text</pull-quote>. This web component allows you to easily add a pull quote to your site. The component is built using web components, so it can be used in any web project, regardless of the framework or CMS you are using.</p>
        <p>Here's a bunch of words that could be in the middle of an article that is really complex and deep but at some point an important fact <pull-quote>really needs to be emphasized to the reader</pull-quote>. But we don't want to take the words out of the flow of the writing or duplicate it but we're going to have a bunch more words to fill in the space. This paragraph needs a lot more words to make it effective.</p>
        <p>Another paragraph for effect. And another sentence. Or more with feeling. I need to really figure out a way to generate text from the editor don't I?</p>
        <p>Need more text and will add more text here and here and a bunch more words and more words. Now a period. But more words.</p>
